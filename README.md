## 💼 **Professional Experience & Private Projects**

1. **Full System Migration and Optimization**  
   - Migrated a complex system with three frontends, three backends, and three large databases from shared hosting to VPS.  
   - Dockerized the entire stack and implemented seamless CI/CD pipelines using **special deployment strategies** to ensure zero downtime during rollouts.  
   - Handled CDN and server security, improved backend responsiveness from 45 to over 1000 requests per second, and optimized resource usage to below 25%.  
   - Implemented DDoS protection and scalable infrastructure despite the system’s monolithic origins.  

2. **WordPress Performance Optimization**  
   - Optimized a WordPress site’s response time from 12 seconds to 2 seconds on VPS, enhancing GTmetrix scores from F to D.  

3. **Dockerization & CI/CD**  
   - Dockerized multiple projects with minimal image sizes and automated deployment to private registries.  
   - Streamlined multi-environment CI/CD processes to enable rapid deployments.  

4. **Code Security & Quality Assurance**  
   - Integrated **SonarQube** and **vulnerability scanning tools** into CI/CD pipelines to ensure code quality and secure codebases.  

5. **Custom Testing Framework Integration**  
   - Integrated test scripts, developed by various department heads, into CI/CD pipelines to provide real-time feedback on code stability and functionality during the development lifecycle.  

6. **Advanced Logging & Monitoring**  
   - Designed a robust logging and monitoring system with **Sentry** and **ELK Stack**, ensuring real-time issue tracking and granular visibility into application performance.  
   - Implemented log rotation and access management to optimize log processing and storage.  

7. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**  
   - Developed a comprehensive RBAC system for CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure, allowing granular access to logs, monitoring dashboards, and deployment reports.  
   - Enabled developers and stakeholders to access relevant data and self-troubleshoot issues without escalating to higher roles.  

8. **Server-Side Caching**  
   - Implemented intelligent caching mechanisms to reduce response times and boost application performance.  

9. **Custom Notification Systems**  
   - Built notification integrations for Slack, Telegram, Discord, and email with detailed context, user activity tracking, and push details.  

10. **Automation & Infrastructure Management**  
    - Automated routine tasks with scripts and Ansible playbooks, covering auto-backup, firewall rule updates, and server maintenance.  
11. **Advanced Log Monitoring with AI Integration**  
    - Developed an AI-powered monitoring system to analyze logs and identify unusual traffic or suspicious behavior patterns, providing proactive threat detection and alerting.
12. **BTC Price Prediction Model**  
    - Created an AI model that performs price prediction for Bitcoin based on historical data, allowing for configurable time-step predictions to assess potential market trends.  
13. **Hobby Projects**  
    - I have a passion for building innovative solutions using Arduino or electronics and have developed several creative projects available in my GitHub Repositories.
