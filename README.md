  <summary>üíº Professional Experience & Projects</summary>

1. **Full System Migration and Optimization**  
   - Migrated a complex system with three frontends, three backends, and three large databases from shared hosting to VPS.  
   - Dockerized the entire stack and implemented seamless CI/CD pipelines using **special deployment strategies** to ensure zero downtime during rollouts.  
   - Handled CDN and server security, improved backend responsiveness from 45 to over 1000 requests per second, and optimized resource usage to below 25%.  
   - Implemented DDoS protection and scalable infrastructure despite the system‚Äôs monolithic origins.  

2. **WordPress Performance Optimization**  
   - Optimized a WordPress site‚Äôs response time from 12 seconds to 2 seconds on VPS, enhancing GTmetrix scores from F to D.  

3. **Dockerization & CI/CD**  
   - Dockerized multiple projects with minimal image sizes and automated deployment to private registries.  
   - Streamlined multi-environment CI/CD processes to enable rapid deployments.  

4. **Code Security & Quality Assurance**  
   - Integrated **SonarQube** and **vulnerability scanning tools** into CI/CD pipelines to ensure code quality and secure codebases.
